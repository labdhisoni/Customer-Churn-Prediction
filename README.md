# Customer Churn Prediction 📉

This project predicts whether a telecom customer will churn (i.e., leave the service) using machine learning models. It helps businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive retention actions.

## 💡 Objective
To use customer behavioral and service data to predict churn using a Random Forest model.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 🔍 Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values and fixed data types.
2. **Encoding** – Converted categorical variables into numeric.
3. **Modeling** – Trained a Random Forest classifier.
4. **Evaluation** – Accuracy ~82%, with key features like Monthly Charges, Tenure, and Contract Type.
5. *(Optional)* Power BI dashboard for visual insights.

## 📈 Outcome
- Predictive accuracy of ~82%
- Identified patterns in customer churn behavior
